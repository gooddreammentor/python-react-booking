# Firefly Health Take Home Interview

Hello and thank you for interviewing with Firefly!

This document is not the interview — it is a "pre-brief" to make sure your environment and expectations are properly calibrated before beginning.

Please make sure you read through this document thoroughly. Once you are ready, the prompt can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## What to expect

This is meant to be a demonstration of your full-stack coding abilities. This means that it is perfectly fine to Google, refer to documentation / Stack Overflow, and even install packages that you find useful.

Within this repo is a self-contained project reliant on a few technologies — if you're unfamiliar with any of them, it's recommended to take some time to explore before diving in.

You should allocate around 4 hours to dedicate to this task, and submit within 48 hours.

The instructions for the interview can be found [here](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Base Requirements**

- Python 3

- Node 10 (at least)

- npm or yarn

**The Stack**

- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)
- [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

The database is SQLite3, but you shouldn't need to worry about that
